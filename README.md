### The Velodea Group

| Director of Corporate IT & Lead Developer | Milan, Italy / Los Angeles, California |

As lead developer and director of The Velodea Group’s Velotek division, job responsibilities spanned an array of IT related areas including web application development, systems architecture and network infrastructure. Velotek’s primary role consisted of developing web-based product offerings and creating technical solutions for clients.

<!--TODO: bullet point out  3 Velodea projects -->
<!-- * **VeloTrack Web Analytics** -
This project provided web metrics before Google Analytics existed. This was done by collecting traffic, browser & usage data through the inclusion of an invisible gif on each email and web page to be tracked. All reports were custom built and allowed advanced customization.

* **CodeSigning for Kareem** - 
This project consisted of... -->

* **VeloTrack (Site Management and Behavioral Analysis System)** – VeloTrack was a custom-built solution that integrated seamlessly with websites to offer behavioral tracking, email list management, registration, surveying, and demographic-based site usage reporting.  VeloTrack boasted the ability to capture millions of page views per day in a manner completely transparent to the end user.  The system was designed to be highly customizable as well as intuitive in order to allow non-technical clients the ability to generate reports as well as create surveys and construct email marketing campaigns.  All data was also available through HTTP as a Web API for integration into client applications.<br />
**This was a modularized system developed over two years which consisted of equal parts Google Analytics, Constant Contact, Mail Chimp, WordPress & Salesforce before those systems came into being.**

* **VeloTeam (Asset Management Extranet System)** – Velodea’s extranet system managed all documents and materials related to a project while facilitating communication and collaboration between project teams and clients.  Highly customizable document repositories organized and managed all project-based assets.  Additionally, the system managed user accounts, tracked incident resolutions and sent automated email notification to the team when new material was made available to the site.  Use of this system had reduced cost and dramatically increased productivity by shortening the development life cycle of Velodea’s projects.  Over 100 customized instances were rolled out for clients such as Sony, Miramax, Qualcomm, and Toshiba.<br>
**This was a system that provided the capabilities of Basecamp, DropBox, JIRA, and GitHub. It offered project management, document sharing, version control, bug tracking/issue resolution & client communications at a time when those services didn't exist out in the wild.**

_Technologies Used:_ **ASP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, VB, COM, XML; DevOps for Windows Server, Exchange Server & SQL Server platforms & Active Directory Networks.**

### Microsoft Corporation

|      | November 1998 – June 2000 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Release Program Manager | Redmond, Washington |

As a key member of Microsoft’s Product Release team, responsibilities included application development, system design and project management for release of Microsoft product to the marketplace.  Projects driven and developed by myself included:

* **Release To Web System (RTW)** - This suite of applications was the primary release mechanism for product delivery to Microsoft.com worldwide.  The system boasted an average of 1000 releases per month and tracked workflow, sign-off, QA, and virus scan. All released bits were vaulted to a centralized repository within the Software Release Labs.  The application was designed entirely from the ground up to fulfill Microsoft’s need to release product in less than 3 hours.

* **PIRS University** - Product Information Release Services (PIRS) University was an online training center that provided company-wide services and computer-based training related to product release.  This site provided some of the following capabilities: automated content publication for non-technical business process owners, hierarchical management of heterogeneous data and online training registration for course offerings.  This site provided centralized management for what was previously a fragmented information base.

* **Media Shipment Tracking System (ShipInfo)** - The ShipInfo system gathered and tracked all software media shipments made to Microsoft’s third-party manufacturers.  This allowed manufacturing facilities to plan production cycles as well as track the progress of any shipment.  The system consisted of multiple SQL Server databases in each of Microsoft’s regions of operation.  These databases received shipment information through a web-based front end from each of the release labs. The data was then warehoused three times daily to coincide with the close of business at Microsoft’s American, European and Asian operating centers.  The warehoused data was then made available through the corporate extranet to vendors and manufacturers.

Each system was developed according to multi-tier design architecture standards and were built using **HTML, ASP, Visual Basic, JavaScript, VBScript, CSS, and SQL stored procedures**. Where possible, **MTS COM objects** were created for re-usability and programming practices followed a component-based object model.  Additional responsibilities as Release Program Manager ranged from systems analysis to solution implementation and included such things as **application prototyping, database implementation, user-interface design** and **technical, functional & user documentation**.

## My Story

Written as a timeline and narrative

<dl>
  <dt>1994-1997 • DeVry University • Pomona, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Bright-eyed and Bushy Tailed -</i></dd>
    <dd>Schooled at DeVry University in technology, programming, and information systems. Graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (BSc CIS) degree.</dd>
  <dt>1997-1998 • Kirtland AFB • Albuquerque, NM</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Proving Myself -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, NM - Underwent FBI background check and was granted secret clearance to work on web-based collaboration applications dealing with guidance systems and other technologies relevant to our armed forces.</dd>
  <dt>1998 - 2000 • ✨ Microsoft ✨ • Redmond, WA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- The Promised Land -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Microsoft as a Release Program Manager writing web-based applications to manage the release, cataloging, scanning, QA, workflow and distribution of all corporate releases to microsoft.com's Download Center - <b>This was the most creative and engaging work experience of my life. The gold standard to which I measure all others and one I've committed myself to return to.</b></dd>
  <dt>2000 - 2002 • Velodea • Milan, Italy</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- International Man of Mystery -</i></dd>
    <dd>Left Microsoft to join The Velodea Group - Became employee number seven of this dotcom startup. Here I experienced a new level of intensity and round-the-clock work that we justified as necessary "sweat equity". I traveled frequently between the Los Angeles and Milan offices and served as the head of technology and lead developer for many corporate projects, both internal and external.</dd>
  <dt>2002 - 2006 • devAware Technology Solutions • Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Opportunities at Home -</i></dd>
    <dd>Wanting to settle down locally, I transitioned to work as an independent freelance developer under my own company umbrella. This was liberating, stressful, and intensely time consuming. It made me realize I love coding, development, and technology - I do not love corporate administration, legalities, deficit finance, negotiating project costs or collections. I did learn to wear many hats though. I had projects with Sony, Fox Studios and Xtreme Desktops during this time.</dd>
  <dt>2006 - 2014 • Velodea (v3) • Pasadena, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Innocence Lost -</i></dd>
    <dd>Returned to Velodea which had re-branded itself and was under new management. Here I flourished for a time, focusing my efforts on helping lift the company out of a $200k deficit. The success of these endeavors seemed to assure the company's long-term future and had promised me an equity stake.</dd>
    <!--
    <dd>As visibility into company receivables, accounting duties, and signatory authority was consolidated to one role by the CPA/Managing Director, the company began to misplace large sums of money which resulted in employees not getting paid.</dd>
    <dd>This began a long period of  struggle and frustration during which I was witness to greed, dishonesty and corporate shenanigans on a scale unimaginable. The company eventually dissolved due to management's <span style="text-decoration:line-through">embezzlement of payroll, theft of company funds, and personal use of corporate assets</span> misuse of corporate funds.</dd>
    -->
    <dd>A long period of hard work, unflagging commitment, and faith in the company's future concluded with the unthinkable. The company was dissolved due to management's <!--<span style="text-decoration:line-through">theft of company money, embezzlement of payroll, wholesale deception of the employees and stockholders...</span>--> misuse of corporate funds. Well... At least I would be free to look for work with a company whose core values I shared and admired.</dd>
  <dt>2014 - 2016 • <i>Three-year Hiatus</i> • Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Being of Service -</i></dd>
    <dd>Needing a recharge, I took time off to re-evaluate what I wanted my focus and position to be in the the industry. <strong>I knew I wanted to work with a large company and that my passion for code meant I wanted to be part of a development team whose members are as excited about the work as I am. I had clarity.</strong></dd>
    <dd>It was at this point I was called to move in a completely different direction. I was asked to care for a loved one who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I stepped into the role of caregiver and provided in-home care until her passing.</dd>
    <dd><i>This experience showed me what it means to have strength and dignity in the face of the inevitable. I was honored to have been part of this labor of love and in the end, was moved to see that she was able to find meaning in her struggle. She passed away peacefully surrounded by friends, family, and loved-ones. She was thirty seven years old.</i></dd>
  <dt>2016 - 2017 • <i>Education, Certification & Training, Oh My!</i> • Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Full Circle -</i></dd>
    <dd>I re-engaged with the development community and have been coding, reading, learning, and absorbing with a passion. I didn't want to just throw myself into the job market without first thoroughly mastering some of today's current and most in-demand web dev technologies. I had many paths to choose from but decided to settle on technologies I knew and loved. <strong>I focused my efforts on full-stack development, .NET Core & Azure cloud-based services.</strong></dd>
    <dd>So, I jumped into the world of MOOCs, boot camps, and classes by training 8-12 hours a day, five to six days per week. I'm still in the middle of this process and am excited to make the transition to full-time employee where I'll be able to reengage with a team, contribute to the whole, and be one among many once again.</dd>
